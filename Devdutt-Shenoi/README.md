# Devdutt-Shenoi
Also known as Dev, I am a Pythonista by blood, having done too much of JS, currently rocking with GO-lang!

So, hey! being a college transfer case, coming into the second year, i.e. CS3A I am excited to be a part of the legacy of FOSSMEC!
I myself have contributed to a few Open-Source and libre projects and am also interested in building my own side projects. I am a
linux-or-die guy and have been mostly using FOSS in daily life, ofcourse, except for GitHub! I guess I'll leave the rest to your imagination!
